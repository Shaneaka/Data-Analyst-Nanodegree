# Project 1: Investigate a dataset from 'The Movie Database'
For this project I will investiage the data from 'The Movie Database' (TMDb). This dataset contains data such as genre, release_year, cast, revenue, and budget on over 10,000 movies. As part of my investation and analysis I will answer the following questions:

Questions Posed:

>1. What genres of movies have higher ratings?
>2. Do the genre(s) with higher ratings change over time?
>3. Does release date contribute to increased revenues?
>4. Does runtime contribute to the popularity of a movie?

Throught out this process I will show the steps I've taken to characterize, clean, and analyze the data. Then I will conclude with my final resuls.
